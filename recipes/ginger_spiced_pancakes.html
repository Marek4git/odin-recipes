    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In hopes of creating pancakes that remind me of the Christmas season, I came up with these ginger pancakes. 
        These are a delicious way to celebrate Christmas breakfast with your family.</p>
    

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon applesauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 cups baking mix</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat milk, egg, applesauce, ground ginger, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk baking mix into the milk mixture until just combined into a loose batter.</li>
            <li>Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Ladle about 1/4 cup batter into the prepared skillet; cook until bubbles begin to form on the top, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                Turn the pancake and continue cooking until the other side of the pancake is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes more. 
                Transfer pancake to a plate and cover with a lid to keep warm. Repeat until batter is completely used.</li>
        </ol>
